    "    \n",
    "- I studied statistical methodology on EEG with applications to Brain-Computer Interfaces as my dissertation topic.\n",
    "- The particular modality is P300 Event-Related Response (ERP) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI).\n",
    "- This is used for ordinary communications when users cannot type words due to a physical disability, such as ALS or stroke.\n",
    "- Users are asked to wear an EEG cap, sit in front of a virtual screen, and respond to the stimuli on the virtual screen.\n",
    "    - <img src=\"figures/p300-eeg-bci-illustration.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "    - YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIr2cRKFolY&t=1s (Data collection starts from 2:16).\n",
    "- The biological mechanism is that when the human brain is exposed to a relevant but rare external stimuli, the brain elicits a so-called (target) P300 ERP that can be captured via the EEG recording, otherwise, when the human brain is exposued to a irrelevant (but regular) external stimuli, the brain does not elicit this P300 ERP. To simplify, we call it an non-target P300 ERP.\n",
    "- The conventional framework is shown\n",
    "    - <img src=\"figures/bci_conventional_framework.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "    - The statistical problem is simply a **binary classification** problem.\n",
    "- The resulting dataset contains a truncated EEG signal matrix of which dimension is (3420, 400) and labeled vector of which dimension is (3420, 1) telling whether it is a target or non-target stimuli.\n",
    "    - <img src=\"figures/eeg_signal_data_structure.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "    - Here, 3420 refers to the total number of stimuli, while 400 is the total feature length.\n",
    "    - The truncated dataset has 16 electrode, and each electrode has a 25 time points corresponding to the first 800 ms after each stimulus.\n",
    "    - <img src=\"figures/electrode_location.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "- In HW 7, you are going to **validate the signal component between target and non-target ERPs**, which is an important descriptive step right after signal processing and feature extraction. In later HWs, you will have the chance to explicitly perform signal processing and feature extraction, perform binary classification tasks using various ML methods, and convert them into character-level probability calculation."
